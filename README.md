# Overview of Project:

Dana's goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. So, she essentially needs to build two things: the webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).

# Results:
The first task was to convert the array into a HTML table and fill it with the data from data.js. She also linked image and a style sheet as well as javascript scripts.

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of 
Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.


With her developing coding skills Dana created filters to help users search based on different criteria that includes single or more elements at a time search.
