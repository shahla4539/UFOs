# UFOs

## Overview of Project:

Dana's goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. So, she essentially needs to build two things: the webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).

## Results:
The first task was to convert the array into a HTML table and fill it with the data from data.js. She also linked image and a style sheet as well as javascript scripts.

With her developing coding skills Dana created filters to help users search based on different criteria that includes single or more elements at a time search.



<form>                     
  
                        <p>Filter Search</p>
                      </form>                    
        
                            <li class="bg-dark">
                                <label for="date">Enter Date</label></li>
                                <input type="text" placeholder="1/10/2010" id="datetime" />
                            </li>
                            <li class="bg-dark">
                                <label for="date">Enter a City</label></li>
                                <input type="text" placeholder="benton" id="city" />
                            </li>
        
                            <li class="bg-dark">
                                <label for="date">Enter a State</label></li>
                                <input type="text" placeholder="ca" id="state" />
                            </li>
                            <li class="bg-dark">
                                <label for="date">Enter a Country</label></li>
                                <input type="text" placeholder="us" id="country" />
                            </li>
                            <li class="bg-dark">
                                <label for="date">Enter a Shape</label></li>
                                <input type="text" placeholder="circle" id="shape" />
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </from> 
                    
                    
                    
   
   
Dana created different search criterias. Below is the image where I filtered date only and it gave the data of that particular date.

One can also search data based on two criteria and the filter will bring up the data that will have that particularly common elements as for example in the image below I searched for the date **1/9/2010** and city **woodbridge**.

## Summary: 
Overall Dana did great work but there is still room for improvement. One of the major drawback of her webpage is there is no visual presentation.

## Recommendation:
For better visualization **Histograms** can be added to visualize specific aspects of the data such as UFO sightings by year, frequesncy of UFO sighting shapes, and UFO sightings by specific states.
