# UFOs

# Overview of Project:

Dana's goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. So, she essentially needs to build two things: the webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).

# Results:
The first task was to convert the array into a HTML table and fill it with the data from data.js. She also linked image and a style sheet as well as javascript scripts.

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.


After converting array in to table Dana created filters to help users search based on different criteria. 
<form>
                      
  
                        <p>Filter Search</p>
